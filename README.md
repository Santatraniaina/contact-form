![Design preview for the Contact form coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## 👋 Hi there!

This project is about building a contact form and styling it to match the provided design as closely as possible.

I primarily used **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript** to complete this challenge, keeping it simple and leveraging my foundational JavaScript knowledge. The form is fully **responsive** and works well across different screen sizes.

## 🚀 Features

- Form field validation with clear error messages.
- Support for checkboxes and radio buttons.
- Automatic form reset after successful submission.
- Modern, responsive design suitable for both desktop and mobile devices.
- Custom fonts and a consistent color palette.

## 🌐 Live Demo

You can view the live demo on GitHub Pages: [Contact Form](https://santatraniaina.github.io/contact-form/)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the form structure.
- **CSS3**: For styling and responsive design.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: For validation and dynamic interactions.
